# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you have found a security vulnerability in our project, please report it to us by emailing [security@example.com]. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Security Update Process

Upon receiving a security report, we will promptly acknowledge it and investigate any claims. If we confirm a vulnerability, we will take the following steps:
- Work on a fix in a private branch.
- Prepare a security advisory or release to disclose the issue responsibly.
- Deploy the fix and ensure the community is aware and can update their installations.

Please do not disclose the issue publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

## Acknowledgments

Contributors who report security issues will be acknowledged for their efforts to make our project safer.
