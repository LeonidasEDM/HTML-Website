                        <span class="tab">Hello</span> there! I'm Alfonso and I'm currently pursuing my Software Engineering Degree.
                        I've been learning programming since high school when I took AP Computer Science Principles.
                        I created a game that not only earned the maximum score on the AP exam but also ignited a passionate flame within me for coding. <br><br>

                        <span class="tab">Throughout</span> my academic journey at FGCU, I've engaged in diverse projects, delving into various aspects of software engineering.
                        This included delving into Object-Oriented programming using C++, Server Administration with Red Hat Linux, and my recent favorite pursuit,
                        Machine Learning Algorithms, employing Python alongside the powerful NumPy and Pandas Libraries. While there's still much to learn on this exciting journey,
                        I've decided to focus primarily on AI development. The reason for this choice is simple: my experiences with machine learning were so captivating that
                        I believe that fully immersing myself in the world of AI, with its rapid evolution,
                        would provide me with the opportunity to venture into the forefront of innovation.
                        I aspire to push myself into uncharted territory, testing the boundaries of what's possible.

                    Systems Administration & Programming, and especially Data Mining & Knowledge Discovery have not only broadened my knowledge but also deepened my appreciation for
                    the complexities of Software Engineering. I've maintained a 3.77 GPA and earned a place in the honors college by simply following my values and working hard on
                    what I'm passionate about. Moreover, engaging in a mix of assigned and self-directed projects has allowed me to practically apply and challenge my understanding
                    of certain concepts. These are a few of the projects I've worked on so far

                                The project investigates the use and integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly a customized
                                version of OpenAI's GPT, into the academic paper evaluation process. The aim is to see if AI can be used as an assistant

                                fruitful, as it has shown that a custom GPT is capable of responding in different formats that favor feedback quality
                                and integrity as well as remain consistant and detailed.
